# Image Elements
Images should generally be in PNG format, because PNG has the best support for transparency. They can, however, be in any format supported by WebKit, including BMP, GIF, and JPEG.

*Image elements are defined under the "images" section in the manifest.json file.*

# Description of Elements
## Basic Theme Elements
These elements are the starting point, by using only them, you can quickly create a basic theme.

### Image Elements
#### theme_frame
This image represents the area behind the tabs. There is no strict dimensions for this image, the rest of the area in the frame that is not covered by this image is covered by the color element frame. It would be helpful to know that this image by default repeats along the x-axis. Hence if you create a small square image, it will be automatically repeated along x-axis-which means you can create patterns if you use short sized images.

Remember this image doesn't repeat along-y, hence make sure it is long enough to cover the toolbar area-anything over 80px height is good, usually with grading alpha transparency at the bottom so that the image blends with the `"frame"` color. (you can create a large sized frame image, that extends and coveres the frame borders too)

Else you might see a small seperation to the extreme top left of the frame, when the window is in restored mode due to the wrong size of the image.

Alternatively one can decide to create an image with width-long enough that the image repetition is not seen-this method allowes you to create one continuous design for the frame-but this method might slow down the loading time of the theme since large resolution screens require image of larger width (or else you'll see the repetition of the image). Note that if you don't include this image, the default frame of chrome is displayed, the color element  `"frame"` doesn't override this.

#### theme_ntp_background
This is the image that is displayed at the large white space in the browser, in the new tab page, it can contain a background image that contains alpha transparency. Note that the notation ntp represents new tab page, hence all elements which contain ntp in the notation will correspond to some element inside the new tab page.

There are two ways you can create the inner background for the browser-use a large image without repetition/tiling or use a small image that repeats in x-axis and/or y-axis. (see `"ntp_background_repeat"`).

There is also option for you to select the alignment of this image, by default the image is center aligned, but you may choose to align it the way you want. (see `"ntp_background_alignment"`).

#### theme_tab_background
This is an image, this represents the tabs - all the inactive tabs.

Usually a less saturated image of `"theme_toolbar"` is used for this. You may also design something else, but make sure that the design enables the user to distinguish the inactive tabs from the active one! This image also tiles default in x-axis and the height of this can be around 65p, the width is up to you.

#### theme_toolbar
This is an image that covers the area of the current tab and the toolbar below it. For older versions of Google Chrome, make sure this image is over 119px in height because the find bar (which appears when you press Ctrl+F ) shares the tool bar image, the width is up to you. Similar to the `"theme_frame"`, this image also tiles along the x-axis so you have the option to create pattern or create a long width image for the toolbar. Remember that the toolbar contains some buttons and when the bookmarks are visible (CMD+B or Ctrl+B), they too occupy space in the toolbar.

So don't make the design too much crowded, or else the toolbar will not be visually appealing. Usually for the toolbar, a square, tiling image is preferred, which might be a gradient or just plain color.


## Advanced Theme Elements
Use these to create a more advanced theme.

### Image Elements
#### theme_button_background
This is the image that specifies the background for various buttons (stop, refresh, back, forward, etc..) in the toolbar. This image is optional, if you do not include this image, the color element `"button_background"` overrides the button's background color.

#### theme_frame_inactive
This is an image, representing the area behind the tabs, when the chrome window is out of focus/inactive.

All that is applicable to `"theme_frame"`, applies to this. Usually to avoid making the theme heavy, you can go for `"frame_inactive"` tint, to show that the window is inactive-it's efficient than creating a whole new image. But it's up to the designer to decide, if it's going to be an image seperately for the inactive state or there is going to be a color tint when the window is inactive.

#### theme_frame_incognito
This is similar to the `"theme_frame"`, but this image represents the frame of a window in incognito mode. You may choose to redesign the image specially for the incognito mode or ignore this, so that whatever you made for `"theme_frame"` will be tinted (see `"frame_incognito"`) and used in incognito mode (it's by default that it gets a dark tint in incognito mode).

#### theme_frame_incognito_inactive
This is also an image, similar to `"theme_frame_inactive"`, but this image is for the inactive frame of a window in incognito mode (see `"frame_incognito_inactive"`).

#### theme_frame_overlay
This is the image that will be displayed at the top left corner of the frame, over the `"theme_frame"` image. Also this image doesn't repeat by default. Hence this image may be used in case you don't want the frame area design to repeat. Similar to the `"theme_frame"`, anything over 80px height is good, usually with grading alpha transparency at the bottom so that the image blends with the `"frame"` color.

#### theme_frame_overlay_inactive
This is similar to `"theme_frame_overlay"`, but will be displayed when the browser window is inactive. If you do not include this image, `"theme_frame_overlay"` image will be darkly tinted and used by default-to denote the inactive frame.

#### theme_ntp_attribution
This is the image that is displayed at the bottom right corner of the new tab page. Google Chrome automatically puts a heading "Theme created by" and below that displays whatever image you give as `"theme_ntp_attribution"`.

A good practice is to create a small png file enough for an aurthor name 
(and contact if needed) with alpha transparency background. Making large and more color intense image will attract view, but will make the theme a bit heavier (the file size of the theme may increase with bigger png file) but it's your choice anyway.

#### theme_tab_background_incognito
This is an image, that represents the inactive tabs, in the incognito mode. Alternatively one can use the tinting `"background_tab"`, to effect inactive tabs in incognito mode, but there is a slight problem that some may want to avoid even if you tint the inactive tabs of the incognito window, the inactive tabs are made transparent (by default). Hence they'll show the area behind them. i.e. the frame. If you want to avoid this, you can include this image.

#### theme_tab_background_v
This is an image that serves to function as an alternative tab background 
when Google Chrome is used in Aero mode. v may stand for 'vista', etc.

#### theme_window_control_background
This is the image that specifies the background for the window control buttons (minimize, maximize, close and new tab). This image is also not necessary until you desperatly need to change the control button background. If the image is included, the browser leaves off 1px at the top and left of image and maps a 16px height button from it, the width varies according to buttons though.

If this image is not included, the control buttons assume the background color specified in the color element `"button_background"`.

### Color Elements
#### bookmark_text
This is a color element that specifies the color of the text of bookmarks in the toolbar and the text for the download bar that appears at the bottom. 
**Note:** During a download, the text color indicating the number of MB downloaded is not configurable.

#### button_background
This is a color element that specifies the color for the background of all the buttons in the toolbar area (back, forward, bookmark, etc..). This element too can contain opacity values like the toolbar, which will affect the opacity of the window control buttons (minimize, maximize, close).

#### control_background
This should specify the color of the control buttons of window control buttons (minimize, maximize, close).

#### frame
This is a color element, that specifies the color of the frame area of the browser (the area behind the tabs + the border). It occupies the area that is not covered by the `"theme_frame"` image. The format to specify this element in the manifest.json file is: `"frame": [R, G, B]`

#### frame_inactive
This is a color element, that specifies the color of the frame area of the browser but when the window is inactive/out of focus (the area behind the tabs + the border). It occupies the area that is not covered by the `"theme_frame"` image. The format to specify this element in the manifest.json file is: `"frame_inactive" : [R,G,B]`

#### frame_incognito
This is a color element similar to `"frame"`, but under the incognito mode.

#### frame_incognito_inactive
This is a color element similar to `"frame_inactive"`, but under the incognito mode.

#### ntp_background
This is a color element that specifies the color of the background of the new tab page (covers all areas that is not mapped by `"theme_ntp_background"`). Usually if a alpha transparency is employed in the image element `"theme_ntp_background"`, make sure that `"ntp_background"` is such that it matches that image element.

#### ntp_header
This is a color element that specifies the color for the frame of quick link buttons, when one hovers the mouse over it. It also specifies the 1px border color of the toolbar element, the `"ntp_section"` element and the color of three small buttons in the new tab page-thumbnail view, list view, change page layout.

#### ntp_link
This is a color element that specifes the color of all the links that may appear in the new tab page. (currently the links under list view and links of tips that appear at the bottom of new tab page takes it's color from this).

#### ntp_link_underline
This is a color element that specifies the color of the underline of all links in the new tab page (the color of underline of the `"ntp_link"` element).
 
#### ntp_section
This is a color element that specifies the color for the border of the quick link buttons and also the background color for the recently closed bar that appears above the tips area. Similar to the toolbar element, this can als contain opacity value.

#### ntp_section_link
This is a color element that specifies the color of all the links that appear in the section area. Currently all the links in the "Recently closed" bar take their color from this.

#### ntp_section_link_underline
This is a color element that specifies the color of underlines of all the links that appear in the section area. (underlines the `"ntp_section_link"` element).

#### ntp_section_text
This is a clolor element that specifies the color of all the text that appears in the section area.

#### ntp_text
This is a color element that specifies the color of all the text that appears in the new tab page. (tips, quick access lables, etc..).

#### tab_background_text
This is a color element that specifies the color of the title text of all the inactive tabs/out of focus tabs.

#### tab_text
This is a color element that specifies the color of the title text of the current tab (tab title name of current tab).

#### toolbar
This is a color element that specifies the background color of the bookmarks bar, that is visible only in the new tab page, when you press the shortcut keys Ctrl+B or CMD+B. And it contains a 1px border whose color is defined by `"ntp_header"`. Also this element can contain an opacity value that effects transparency of this bar. Note that opacity value are float values that ranges from 0 to 1, 0 being fully transparent and 1 being fully opaque.

The format to specify this element in the manifest.json file is : 
`"toolbar": [R, G, B, opacity]`
E.g. `"toolbar": [25, 154, 154, 0.5]`

Note that this element also specifies color value of the background for floating the status bar (in the bottom of page). It's found that using opacity values for this element makes the status bar transparent, but the text inside it will contain a opaque background of same color-hence area without the text will be transparent.

## Tint Elements
The tint elements are used to assign color tints to certain elements of the browser area. The value of the tint is in floating values ranging from 0 to 1 and -1.0 means no change. 
E.g, `"buttons": [0.3, 0.5, 0.5]` (the values range from 0 to 1, hence even 0.125 or 0.65 represent a color).

Here the first value represents the hue value, for which 0 means red and 1 means red. The next is saturation value that lets you set vibrancy of the color, here 0 means completely desaturated and 1 means fully saturated. The next value is lightness/brightness value. Here 0 means least bright and 1 means most bright

#### buttons
This is a tint element, that is used to specify a color tint for icons inside all the buttons in the toolbar (back, forward, refresh, etc..).

#### frame
This is a tint element, that is used to specify a color tint for the frame area. Whatever image you've created for the frame area will be tinted with a color that you specify here.

#### frame_inactive
This is a tint element, similar to the tint element frame, but the tint is applied when the window is inactive/out of focus.

#### frame_incognito
This is a tint element, that is used to specify a color tint for the frame area in incognito mode. Whatever image you've created for the frame area will be tinted with a color that you specify here.

#### frame_incognito_inactive
This is a tint element, that is used to specify a color tint for the frame area in incognito mode, but when the window is inactive/out of focus.
 
#### background_tab
This is a tint element,that specifies the color tint of the inactive tabs in incognito mode.

## Property Elements
#### ntp_background_alignment
This is a property element, that is used to control the alignment property of the image element `"theme_ntp_background"`. The value for this element is entered as follows: `"ntp_background_alignment": "VALUE"`

In the place of VALUE, you can enter either `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"left"` or `"right"`. Further you can use combinations like `"top-left"`, `"bottom-right"`, etc… 
The difference is that using only `"left"`, aligns the background image to the left center of the new tab page. While using 
`"top-left"` aligns the image to the top left corner of the new tab page. 
E.g. `"ntp_background_alignment": "bottom-left"` (Note that the default alignment of the background image is `"center"`).

#### ntp_background_repeat
This is a property element, that is used to control the repetition of the image element "theme_ntp_background". It is specified as:

`"ntp_background_repeat": "VALUE"`

In the place of VALUE, you can enter either `"repeat"`, `"no-repeat"`, `"repeat-x"` or `"repeat-y"`. Depending upon the image you've created as the background you can choose to repeat the image along x-axis or y-axis or turn repeat off, since repeat is on by default!

#### ntp_logo_alternate
This is a propety element that specifies what header of Google chrome you wnat for your theme. It is specified as follows:

`"ntp_logo_alternate": VALUE`

Note that this element's value should not be entered in double quotes! In the place of VALUE you can enter 0 or 1. Choosing 0 will give you a colorful Google Chrome header logo inside the new tab page. Choosing 1 will give you an all white Google Chrome header logo inside the new tab page.

# Packaging
This page describes how to package your extension. Extensions are packaged as signed ZIP files with the file extension "crx"—for example, myextension.crx.
**Note:** You do not need to package your own extension. If you publish your extension using the [**Chrome Developer Dashboard**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard "Chrome Developer Dashboard"), then the only reason to create your own .crx file would be to distribute a non-public version—for example, to alpha testers. When you package an extension, the extension is assigned a unique key pair. The extension's ID is based on a hash of the public key. The private key is used to sign each version of the extension and must be secured from public access. Be careful not to include your private key within your extensions!

## Creating a package
To package an extension:

1.	Bring up the Extensions management page by going to this URL: **chrome://extensions**
2.	Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
3.	Click the **Pack extension** button. A dialog appears.
4.	In the **Extension root directory** field, specify the path to the extension's folder, for example, C:\myext. (Ignore the other field; you don't specify a private key file the first time you package a particular extension.)
5.	Click **Package**. The packager creates two files: a .crx file, which is the actual extension that can be installed, and a .pem file, which contains the private key.

**Do not lose the private key!** Keep the .pem file secret and in a safe place. You'll need it later if you want to do any of the following:

•	[**Update**](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging#update) the extension

•	[**Upload**](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging#upload) the extension to the Chrome Web Store

If the extension is successfully packaged, you'll see a dialog like this that tells you where to find the .crx and .pem files:
![alt text](https://developer.chrome.com/static/images/package-success.png "Package success")

## Updating a package
To create an updated version of your extension:

1.	Increase the version number in manifest.json.
2.	Bring up the Extensions management page by going to this URL: **chrome://extensions**
3.	Click the **Pack extension** button. A dialog appears.
4.	In the Extension root directory field, specify the path to the extension's folder, for example, C:\myext.
5.	In the Private key file field, specify the location of the already generated .pem file for this extension, for example, C:\myext.pem.
6.	Click OK.

If the updated extension is successfully packaged, you'll see a dialog like this:
 ![alt text](https://developer.chrome.com/static/images/update-success.png "Update success")

## Uploading a previously packaged extension to the Chrome Web Store
You can use the Chrome Developer Dashboard to upload an extension that you've previously packaged yourself. However, unless you take special steps, the extension's ID in the Chrome Web Store will be different from its ID in the package you created. This different ID might be a problem if you've distributed your extension package, because it allows users to install multiple versions of your extension, each with its own local data.

If you want to keep the extension ID the same, follow these steps:

1.	Rename the private key that was generated when you created the .crx file to key.pem.
2.	Put key.pem in the top directory of your extension.
3.	Compress that directory into a ZIP file.
4.	Upload the ZIP file using the [**Chrome Developer Dashboard**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard "Chrome Developer Dashboard").

## Packaging at the command line
Another way to package extensions is by invoking chrome.exe at the command line. Use the `--pack-extension` flag to specify the location of the extension's folder. Use `--pack-extension-key` to specify the location of the extension's private key file. For example:

`chrome.exe –pack-extension=C:\myext –pack-extension-key=C:\myext.pem`

## Package format and scripts
For more information on the format, as well as pointers to scripts you can use to create .crx files, see [**CRX Package Format**](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/crx "CRX Package Format").
